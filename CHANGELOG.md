## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Protocol-agnostic `Host` contracts with secret-safe `HostConfig` URI
  dispatch, lifecycle management, normalized host information, and explicit
  capability reporting.
- Local, SSH, WinRM, Docker Engine container, and QEMU Guest Agent hosts with
  buffered command execution and `pathlib_next.Path` filesystem backends where
  the transport supports them. WinRM includes a Windows-semantic PowerShell
  path backend; container and QEMU paths use archive and guest-agent file RPCs.
- Explicit and auto-detected shell dialects (POSIX, Bash, Zsh, Fish, CMD, and
  PowerShell), shared structured quoting, environment/cwd helpers, operators,
  and persistent SSH/container sessions with optional terminals.
- Raw serial and QEMU serial-console transports with validated UART settings,
  exclusive process leases, stream lifecycle controls, and explicit
  non-shell semantics until a console profile is supplied.
- Optional native integrations: AsyncSSH/SFTP, pywinrm, Docker SDK, PySerial,
  and libvirt QGA, each isolated behind a matching package extra.
- Subprocess-shaped execution options, normalized transport errors, bounded
  buffered file transfers, and Python 3.9+ typing support (Python 3.14 is the
  default development interpreter).
